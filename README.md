A VSCode extension that uses the inlay hints to
render csvs as columns.

![git](csv-aligner1.gif)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning! This extension needs the October 2024 VSCode release.** ‚ö†Ô∏è 

**Tip: We recommend that this is used with the rainbow csv extension, which will color the columns.**

A CSV like this:

```csv
grant,murphy,whaddup,1234,dog
d-train,mochi,hi,1,kitten
```

Would be rendered like this:

```csv
grant  ,murphy,whaddup,1234,dog
d-train,mochi ,hi     ,1   ,kitten
```
