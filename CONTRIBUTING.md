# Setup

## npm packages

- **package.json**: run `npm install`

## Global Packages

- **node**: need this to run things.
- **vsce**: need this to package and push to vs code market.

You can just install
the two globally, or you can use direnv and nix.
This is done with **shell.nix** and **.envrc**.
